I decided to create a Pittsburgh food spots recommendation site for my project. I really enjoy exploring new restaurants and food spots and I wanted to have a convenient way to share these recommendations with others. Right now, I keep my favorite restaurants bucketed by cuisine type in a Google My Maps map and will look up restaurants in my lists when someone asks me for a recommendation. By creating this site, I can publicly share my recommendations with Pittsburgh-area friends and enable them to quickly take action from my site, including getting to each restaurant's website, placing online orders where applicable, opening map locations to navigate to the restaurants on a smartphone, and clicking to call the restaurant directly from the site. Given the current situation, I've also included current status information about how each restaurant is making food available to patrons during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over time, I'd like to get all of my restaurant recommendations added to this site and to build out even more robust content for each restaurant, such as hours of operation/an indicator displaying whether or not the restaurant is currently open, the name of the neighborhood where each restaurant is located, and a map with locations of all restaurants within a cuisine category to make it easier for users to determine quickly which restaurants are near them. I also plan to replace the images I've included for each restaurant from Yelp, Trip Advisor, and the restaurants' websites with ones that I take myself as I get food from each of these restaurants moving forward.
